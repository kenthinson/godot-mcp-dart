# Core types

Godot has a rich set of classes and templates that compose its core,
and everything is built upon them.

This reference will try to list them in order for their better
understanding.

## Allocating memory

Godot has many tricks for ensuring memory safety and tracking memory
usage. Because of this, the regular C and C++ library calls
should not be used. Instead, a few replacements are provided.

For C-style allocation, Godot provides a few macros:

```cpp
memalloc(size)
memrealloc(pointer)
memfree(pointer)
```

These are equivalent to the usual `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`
of the C standard library.

For C++-style allocation, special macros are provided:

```cpp
memnew(Class)
memnew(Class(args))
memdelete(instance)

memnew_arr(Class, amount)
memdelete_arr(pointer_to_array)
```

These are equivalent to `new`, `delete`, `new[]`, and `delete[]`
respectively.

`memnew`/`memdelete` also use a little C++ magic to automatically call post-init
and pre-release functions. For example, this is used to notify Objects right after
they are created, and right before they are deleted.

## Containers

Godot provides its own set of containers, which means STL containers like `std::string`
and `std::vector` are generally not used in the codebase. See [Why does Godot not use STL (Standard Template Library)?](../../about/faq.md#doc-faq-why-not-stl) for more information.

A 📜 icon denotes the type is part of [Variant](variant_class.md#doc-variant-class). This
means it can be used as a parameter or return value of a method exposed to the
scripting API.

### Relocation safety

Godot's containers assume their elements are [trivially relocatable](https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2020/p1144r5.html).

This means that, if you store data types in it that have pointers to themselves, or are otherwise
[not trivially relocatable](https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2020/p1144r5.html#non-trivial-samples),
Godot might crash. Note that storing **pointers to** objects that are not trivially relocatable, such as some Object
subclasses, is unproblematic and supported.

The reason to assume trivial relocatability is that it allows us to make use of important optimization techniques, such
as relocation by `memcpy` or `realloc`.

[GH-100509](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/100509) tracks this decision.

## Multithreading / Concurrency

#### SEE ALSO
You can find more information on multithreading strategies at [Using multiple threads](../../tutorials/performance/using_multiple_threads.md#doc-using-multiple-threads).

None of Godot's containers are thread-safe. When you expect multiple threads to access them, you must use multithread
protections.

Note that some of the types listed here are also available through the bindings, but the binding types are wrapped with
[RefCounted](../../classes/class_refcounted.md#class-refcounted) (found in the `CoreBind::` namespace). Prefer the primitives listed here when possible, for
efficiency reasons.

## Math types

There are several linear math types available in the `core/math`
directory:

- [core/math](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/core/math)

## NodePath

This is a special datatype used for storing paths in a scene tree and
referencing them in an optimized manner:

- [core/string/node_path.h](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/string/node_path.h)

## RID

RIDs are *Resource IDs*. Servers use these to reference data stored in
them. RIDs are opaque, meaning that the data they reference can't be
accessed directly. RIDs are unique, even for different types of
referenced data:

- [core/templates/rid.h](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/templates/rid.h)

# Compiling for macOS

#### NOTE
This page describes how to compile macOS editor and export template binaries from source.
If you're looking to export your project to macOS instead, read [Exporting for macOS](../../../tutorials/export/exporting_for_macos.md#doc-exporting-for-macos).

## Requirements

For compiling under macOS, the following is required:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).
- [SCons 4.0+](https://scons.org/pages/download.html) build system.
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
  (or the more lightweight Command Line Tools for Xcode).
- [Vulkan SDK](https://sdk.lunarg.com/sdk/download/latest/mac/vulkan-sdk.dmg)
  for MoltenVK (macOS doesn't support Vulkan out of the box).
  The latest Vulkan SDK version can be installed quickly by running
  `misc/scripts/install_vulkan_sdk_macos.sh` within the Godot source repository.

#### NOTE
If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can easily
install SCons using the following command:

```shell
brew install scons
```

Installing Homebrew will also fetch the Command Line Tools
for Xcode automatically if you don't have them already.

Similarly, if you have [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)
installed, you can easily install SCons using the
following command:

```shell
sudo port install scons
```

#### SEE ALSO
To get the Godot source code for compiling, see
[Getting the source](getting_source.md#doc-getting-source).

For a general overview of SCons usage for Godot, see
[Introduction to the buildsystem](introduction_to_the_buildsystem.md#doc-introduction-to-the-buildsystem).

## Compiling

Start a terminal, go to the root directory of the engine source code.

To compile for Intel (x86-64) powered Macs, use:

```shell
scons platform=macos arch=x86_64
```

To compile for Apple Silicon (ARM64) powered Macs, use:

```shell
scons platform=macos arch=arm64
```

If all goes well, the resulting binary executable will be placed in the
`bin/` subdirectory. This executable file contains the whole engine and
runs without any dependencies. Executing it will bring up the Project
Manager.

#### NOTE
Using a standalone editor executable is not recommended, it should be always packaged into a
`.app` bundle to avoid UI activation issues.

#### NOTE
If you want to use separate editor settings for your own Godot builds
and official releases, you can enable
[Self-contained mode](../../../tutorials/io/data_paths.md#doc-data-paths-self-contained-mode) by creating a file called
`._sc_` or `_sc_` in the `bin/` folder.

## Compiling with AccessKit support

AccessKit provides support for screen readers.

By default, Godot is built with AccessKit dynamically linked. You can use it by placing
`accesskit.dylib` alongside the standalone executable or in the app bundle's `Frameworks` folder.

#### NOTE
You can use dynamically linked AccessKit with export templates as well, rename
the DYLIB to `accesskit.{architecture}.dylib`
and place them inside the export template app bundle `Frameworks` folder, and the
libraries will be automatically copied during the export process.

To compile Godot with statically linked AccessKit:

- Download the pre-built static libraries from [godot-accesskit-c-static library](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-accesskit-c-static/releases), and unzip them.
- When building Godot, add `accesskit_sdk_path={path}` to tell SCons where to look for the AccessKit libraries:
  > ```shell
  > scons platform=macos accesskit_sdk_path=<...>
  > ```

#### NOTE
You can optionally build the godot-angle-static libraries yourself with
the following steps:

1. Clone the [godot-accesskit-c-static](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-accesskit-c-static/)
   directory and navigate to it.
2. Run the following command:

```shell
cd accesskit-c
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

The AccessKit static library should be built using the same compiler you are
using for building Godot.

### Automatic `.app` bundle creation

To automatically create a `.app` bundle like in the official builds, use the `generate_bundle=yes` option on the *last*
SCons command used to build editor:

```shell
scons platform=macos arch=x86_64
scons platform=macos arch=arm64 generate_bundle=yes
```

### Manual `.app` bundle creation

To support both architectures in a single "Universal 2" binary,
run the above two commands and then use `lipo` to bundle them together:

```shell
lipo -create bin/godot.macos.editor.x86_64 bin/godot.macos.editor.arm64 -output bin/godot.macos.editor.universal
```

To create a `.app` bundle, you need to use the template located in `misc/dist/macos_tools.app`. Typically, for an optimized
editor binary built with `dev_build=yes`:

```shell
cp -r misc/dist/macos_tools.app ./bin/Godot.app
mkdir -p bin/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS
cp bin/godot.macos.editor.universal bin/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot
chmod +x bin/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot
codesign --force --timestamp --options=runtime --entitlements misc/dist/macos/editor.entitlements -s - bin/Godot.app
```

#### NOTE
If you are building the `master` branch, you also need to include support
for the MoltenVK Vulkan portability library. By default, it will be linked
statically from your installation of the Vulkan SDK for macOS.
You can also choose to link it dynamically by passing `use_volk=yes` and
including the dynamic library in your `.app` bundle:

```shell
mkdir -p <Godot bundle name>.app/Contents/Frameworks
cp <Vulkan SDK path>/macOS/lib/libMoltenVK.dylib <Godot bundle name>.app/Contents/Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib
```

## Running a headless/server build

To run in *headless* mode which provides editor functionality to export
projects in an automated manner, use the normal build:

```shell
scons platform=macos target=editor
```

And then use the `--headless` command line argument:

```shell
./bin/godot.macos.editor.x86_64 --headless
```

To compile a debug *server* build which can be used with
[remote debugging tools](../../../tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.md#doc-command-line-tutorial), use:

```shell
scons platform=macos target=template_debug
```

To compile a release *server* build which is optimized to run dedicated game servers, use:

```shell
scons platform=macos target=template_release production=yes
```

## Building export templates

To build macOS export templates, you have to compile using the targets without
the editor: `target=template_release` (release template) and
`target=template_debug`.

Official templates are *Universal 2* binaries which support both ARM64 and Intel
x86_64 architectures.

- To support ARM64 (Apple Silicon) + Intel x86_64:
  > ```shell
  > scons platform=macos target=template_debug arch=arm64
  > scons platform=macos target=template_release arch=arm64
  > scons platform=macos target=template_debug arch=x86_64
  > scons platform=macos target=template_release arch=x86_64 generate_bundle=yes
  > ```
- To support ARM64 (Apple Silicon) only (smaller file size, but less compatible with older hardware):
  > ```shell
  > scons platform=macos target=template_debug arch=arm64
  > scons platform=macos target=template_release arch=arm64 generate_bundle=yes
  > ```

To create a `.app` bundle like in the official builds, you need to use the
template located in `misc/dist/macos_template.app`. This process can be automated by using
the `generate_bundle=yes` option on the *last* SCons command used to build export templates
(so that all binaries can be included). This will create a `godot_macos.zip` file in `bin/`
and additionally takes care of calling `lipo` to create a *Universal 2* binary from two separate
ARM64 and x86_64 binaries (if both were compiled beforehand).

#### NOTE
You also need to include support for the MoltenVK Vulkan portability
library. By default, it will be linked statically from your installation of
the Vulkan SDK for macOS. You can also choose to link it dynamically by
passing `use_volk=yes` and including the dynamic library in your `.app`
bundle:

```shell
mkdir -p macos_template.app/Contents/Frameworks
cp <Vulkan SDK path>/macOS/libs/libMoltenVK.dylib macos_template.app/Contents/Frameworks/libMoltenVK.dylib
```

In most cases, static linking should be preferred as it makes distribution
easier. The main upside of dynamic linking is that it allows updating
MoltenVK without having to recompile export templates.

If you created the `.app` manually, you can zip the `macos_template.app` folder
to reproduce the `macos.zip` template from the official Godot distribution:

```shell
zip -r9 macos.zip macos_template.app
```

To use your custom export templates, you can select the `godot_macos.zip` file in
the advanced options of your export presets:

![image](engine_details/development/compiling/img/mactemplates.webp)

Alternatively, if you want all your presets to use your custom export template, you
can rename the `godot_macos.zip` file to `macos.zip` and move it to the default
location for export templates:

::
: ~/Library/Application Support/Godot/export_templates/<GODOT_VERSION>/macos.zip

## Cross-compiling for macOS from Linux

It is possible to compile for macOS in a Linux environment (and maybe also in
Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux). For that, you'll need to install
[OSXCross](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross) to be able to use macOS
as a target. First, follow the instructions to install it:

Clone the [OSXCross repository](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross)
somewhere on your machine (or download a ZIP file and extract it somewhere), e.g.:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross.git "$HOME/osxcross"
```

1. Follow the instructions to package the SDK:
   [https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross#packaging-the-sdk](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross#packaging-the-sdk)
2. Follow the instructions to install OSXCross:
   [https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross#installation](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross#installation)

After that, you will need to define the `OSXCROSS_ROOT` as the path to
the OSXCross installation (the same place where you cloned the
repository/extracted the zip), e.g.:

```shell
export OSXCROSS_ROOT="$HOME/osxcross"
```

Now you can compile with SCons like you normally would:

```shell
scons platform=macos
```

If you have an OSXCross SDK version different from the one expected by the SCons buildsystem, you can specify a custom one with the `osxcross_sdk` argument:

```shell
scons platform=macos osxcross_sdk=darwin15
```

## Troubleshooting

### Fatal error: 'cstdint' file not found

If you get a compilation error of this form early on, it's likely because
the Xcode command line tools installation needs to be repaired after
a macOS or Xcode update:

```text
./core/typedefs.h:45:10: fatal error: 'cstdint' file not found
45 | #include <cstdint>
   |          ^~~~~~~~~
```

Run these two commands to reinstall Xcode command line tools
(enter your administrator password as needed):

```shell
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install
```

If it still does not work, try updating Xcode from the Mac App Store and try again.
